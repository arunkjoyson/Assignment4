// This code calculates the amount of paint required for a triangular area, given its width and height.
// It uses the `paintRequiredCalculator` function to determine the amount of paint needed based on the total area and coverage per liter.
// The `calculateTriangleArea` function computes the area of a triangle using the formula: (base * height) / 2.
// The base is calculated as one-third of the width.
// The `main` function sets the dimensions of the triangle, the number of copies, and the coverage per liter.
// It then calculates the total painted area and the amount of paint required, logging the result to the console.
